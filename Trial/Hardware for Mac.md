Just go ahead and get any M chip Mac Laptop. All is good and sufficient for non-extremely-intensive work.
	2021 14" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro processor is good enough.

DATA STORAGE WISE:
	The minimum option of 18 GB of RAM is also probably sufficient for most casual
	users. However, my machine possesses 32 GB of RAM because I work within multiple
	virtual machines simultaneously and parse large data sets daily. The standard 512 GB
	of storage should work fine for most, and external drives are much more affordable
	than embedded storage upgrades. My machine possesses a 4 TB internal storage drive
	because I work with large data sets (breach data) and need the fastest possible drive
	when working with the files. While these are great specs, I overpaid for the luxury.
