Here’s the 80/20 on what you need to get started.

1. A dedicated computer that is only used for investigations
2. Encrypted Email – Use Proton Mail
3. A burner phone number (expensive) or a wifi phone number (cheap or free)
4. A social media profile where your target is most active (choose option 1 or 2)
5. A couple different virtual machines
6. A blog or website (you can use a free blog like WordPress, Blogger, or Medium)
7. A VPN (you should probably have one anyway)

- Female account usually better for sock puppets 
- Burner phones important 
- Burner laptop also good with nothing tying to you ever logged in 
- Use a privacy.com credit card to buy burner 
- VPN matters. Try and use VPN from location of your sock. 
- Phone number should match sock area

Behaviour should be totally seperate to normal persona
